## [Unreleased]

***

## [1.2.5] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- 📷 **Camera Photo API**: Take photos via REST endpoint using device cameras
  - `GET /api/camera/photo?camera=back&quality=80` - Capture JPEG photo
  - `GET /api/camera/list` - List available cameras with capabilities
  - Supports front and back cameras with configurable JPEG quality (1-100)
  - Auto-exposure and auto-focus warmup for optimal photo quality
  - Optimized resolution (~1.2MP) for fast HTTP transfer
  - Compatible with Home Assistant `camera` platform integration

### Fixed
- 🖼️ **Screensaver API State Separation**: Clarified screen status reporting in REST API
  - GET `/api/screen` now separates physical screen state from screensaver overlay state
  - `"on"`: Reports PHYSICAL screen state via PowerManager.isInteractive (true even if screensaver active)
  - `"screensaverActive"`: Separate boolean indicating if screensaver overlay is showing
  - Allows clients to distinguish: screen physically on vs content visible to user
- 🔢 **Version Reporting**: API now dynamically reads version from BuildConfig instead of hardcoded value
  - Automatically syncs with `versionName` in build.gradle
  - No more manual updates needed when version changes
  - Single source of truth for version information
- 🔐 **PIN Input Stability**: Completely refactored PIN masking system for universal device compatibility
  - Now uses native `secureTextEntry` instead of manual bullet masking
  - Fixes duplicate/random character issues on certain Android devices/keyboards
  - Eliminates input desynchronization problems
  - Adds autocomplete prevention (`autoComplete="off"`, `textContentType="none"`, `importantForAutofill="no"`)

***

## [1.2.4] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- 📡 **HTTP Server Screen-Off Availability**: Fixed HTTP server becoming unreachable when screen is off
  - Added `WifiLock (WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF)` to prevent WiFi from sleeping
  - Added `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` to keep CPU active for background HTTP processing
  - Server now remains accessible 24/7 regardless of screen state
  - Locks are automatically released when server stops to preserve battery
- 🔒 **Blocking Overlay**: Bug fixes for blocking overlay display and behavior
- 🔄 **Auto Relaunch External App**: Bug fixes for automatic external app relaunching

***

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-30

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-21

### Changed
- 🎯 **5-Tap Detection System**: Complete redesign for fullscreen detection
  - 5-tap now works **anywhere on the screen** (not just on button)
  - Tap 5 times rapidly anywhere to access settings - no more corner targeting required
  - Uses invisible 1x1 pixel overlay with `FLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH` for fullscreen tap detection

  - Underlying app remains 100% interactive (no touch blocking)
  - Removed button position settings (visual indicator fixed in bottom-right when visible)
  - Same behavior in both WebView and External App modes

### Added
- 🔊 **Volume 5-Tap Gesture**: Alternative to 5tap for accessing PIN screen
  - Press Volume Up or Volume Down 5 times quickly to access settings
  - Works even when volume is at max (use Volume Down) or min (use Volume Up)
  - Only active when kiosk mode (lock task) is enabled
  - Toggle in Settings > Security > "Volume 5-Tap"
- 🎨 **Blocking Overlay**: Configurable overlay to block user interactions
  - Touch Logger countdown feature with coordinates display
  - Configurable via settings

### Fixed
- 🖥️ **Screen On/Off API**: Improved reliability for `/api/screen/on` and `/api/screen/off`

  - Properly manages `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON` flag
- 🔧 **React Native New Architecture**: Fixed compatibility issues with BroadcastReceivers
- 🐛 **Screensaver Wake**: Fixed screensaver not waking properly after touch or motion detection (stale closure issue)
