# FreeKiosk - Frequently Asked Questions

---

## Installation

### Q: Do I need to root my tablet?
**A:** No! FreeKiosk uses Android's official Device Owner API. No root required.

### Q: Do I need Android Studio?
**A:** No! Just ADB tool (15 MB download). See [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

### Q: Can I install from Play Store?
**A:** Yes! Search "FreeKiosk" on Google Play Store, or download APK from [Releases](https://github.com/rushb-fr/freekiosk/releases).

### Q: Which Android versions are supported?
**A:** Android 8.0+ (API 26 and above).

## Device Owner

### Q: What is Device Owner mode?
**A:** Device Owner is Android's official enterprise feature that gives FreeKiosk complete control over the device for full kiosk lockdown. It's like MDM (Mobile Device Management) but built into Android.

### Q: Is Device Owner required?
**A:** No, but **highly recommended** for production use. Without Device Owner, kiosk lockdown is partial (users may exit with back button, see notifications, etc.).

### Q: Can I activate Device Owner after installing FreeKiosk?
**A:** No. Device Owner must be set up on a factory-reset device with no Google accounts. You must factory reset first.

### Q: Factory reset required?
**A:** Yes, for Device Owner activation. This is an Android limitation, not FreeKiosk's.

### Q: Can I remove Device Owner?
**A:** Yes! In FreeKiosk settings, use the "⚠️ Remove Device Owner" button (NOT "Exit Kiosk Mode"). Or via ADB:
adb shell dpm remove-active-admin com.freekiosk/.DeviceAdminReceiver

text

### Q: Does Device Owner void warranty?
**A:** No. Device Owner is an official Android feature with no system modifications.

## Usage

### Q: How to access settings in kiosk mode?
**A:** Tap 5 times in the bottom-right corner, then enter your PIN code.

### Q: Can I use custom URLs?
**A:** Yes! Any HTTPS/HTTP URL works (Home Assistant, dashboards, websites, web apps, etc.).

### Q: Does it work with Home Assistant?
**A:** Perfectly! Many users deploy FreeKiosk for Home Assistant dashboards.

### Q: Can I display local HTML files?
**A:** Currently only HTTP/HTTPS URLs. Local file support coming in v1.1.

### Q: How do I change the URL?
**A:** Tap 5 times bottom-right → Enter PIN → Settings → Change URL.

### Q: I forgot my PIN code. What do I do?
**A:** If Device Owner is active: You'll need to factory reset (or use ADB to remove Device Owner first). This is by design for security.

### Q: Can I rotate between multiple URLs?
**A:** Not yet, but planned for v1.1! You can use a single URL pointing to a page that rotates content.

**A:** Should work, but not officially tested. Device Owner setup may differ on Fire OS.

### Q: Does it work on smartphones?
**A:** Technically yes, but FreeKiosk is optimized for tablets. Phone screens are small for kiosk displays.

### Q: Does it work on Chromebooks?
**A:** No. FreeKiosk is Android-only.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Kiosk mode doesn't lock completely
**A:** Make sure Device Owner is activated. Without Device Owner, lockdown is partial. See [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md#advanced-install-device-owner-mode).

### Q: System notifications still appear
**A:** Device Owner mode blocks all notifications. If they still appear:
1. Verify Device Owner is active: `adb shell dpm list-owners`
2. Reboot tablet
3. Restart kiosk mode

### Q: Samsung update popup appears
**A:** Device Owner mode should block Samsung popups. If they still appear, try:
1. Suspend Samsung system apps in FreeKiosk settings (coming in v1.1)
2. Verify Device Owner: `adb shell dpm list-owners`

### Q: WebView doesn't load my URL
**Causes**:
- URL is not HTTPS/HTTP
- No internet connection
- Self-signed SSL certificate (not trusted)

**Solutions**:
- Use valid HTTPS URL
- Check WiFi connection
- Use trusted SSL certificate

### Q: App crashes on start
**A:** Please report a bug with:
- Device model
- Android version
- Crash logs (if possible)
