## Troubleshooting

### "adb: command not found" (Windows)

**Cause**: Not in platform-tools directory

**Solution**:
cd C:\platform-tools
adb devices



### "Not allowed to set the device owner"

**Cause**: Google account exists on device

**Solution**:
1. Factory reset tablet
2. **DO NOT** add Google account after reset
3. Try Device Owner command again

### "No devices/emulators found"

**Causes**:
- USB cable not connected
- USB debugging not enabled
- Driver issues (Windows)

**Solutions**:
1. Check USB cable is connected
2. Verify USB debugging is enabled
3. Check tablet screen for "Allow USB debugging?" popup
4. Run `adb devices` to verify connection
5. **Windows**: Install [USB drivers](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb)

### Tablet not recognized (Windows)

**Solution**: Install manufacturer's USB drivers
- Samsung: [Samsung USB Driver](https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver)
- Other brands: Search "[Brand] USB driver for Windows"

### "Error: Not enough permissions" (Linux)

**Solution**:
sudo adb kill-server
sudo adb start-server
adb devices



Or configure udev rules (permanent fix):
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules

Add: SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="[vendor_id]", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules



### Device Owner set but kiosk doesn't lock completely

**Solution**:
1. Reboot tablet
2. Open FreeKiosk
3. Go to Settings (5 taps bottom-right)
4. Tap "Exit Kiosk Mode" then "Start Kiosk Mode" again

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to root my tablet?**  
A: No! FreeKiosk uses Android's official Device Owner API (no root required).

**Q: Can I use FreeKiosk without Device Owner?**  
A: Yes! Basic mode works without Device Owner, but lockdown is not complete.

**Q: Does Device Owner void my warranty?**  
A: No. Device Owner is an official Android feature. No modifications are made to the system.

**Q: Can I have multiple apps in Device Owner mode?**  
A: No. Android allows only ONE Device Owner per device. FreeKiosk must be the only one.

**Q: Can I still use my tablet normally after removing Device Owner?**  
A: Yes! Just exit kiosk mode and uninstall. Your tablet returns to normal state.

**Q: Does it work on Fire tablets (Amazon)?**  
A: Should work, but not officially tested. Device Owner setup may differ.
